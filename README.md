# gregori
tiny platformer about a tiny gardener in C++ w/ SDL

## ! UNDER CONSTRUCTION !
I began this project as a way to learn more about SDL. After good initial
results, I decided to try to develop the project into a full game. In order
to do this, I realized that I needed to restructure a lot of my old code to
make it easier to add content. You can check on my progress in the branch
[new-main](https://github.com/baronbird/gregori/tree/new-main).
